# Semi-Autonomous-Robotic-Vehicle
C++ code for MEEC, a semi-autonomous Arduino-based vehicle with a claw mechanism. The code establishes interaction between the microcontroller and the other robot components (e.g motors, servos, and sensors). The repository also has code for the robot's autonomous movemnt and remote control feature.
